Project outline:

LevelMap is the main file  
Movements are buggy  
**To complete the game: 1. make sure to dodge the enemy on first floor  
** 2. cannot land on floating platforms, jump to change them  
** 3. position player so that it is slightly touching the new level  
** 4. run and climb thru the last two monsters to change the last block and complete the game!!!
